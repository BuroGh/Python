        "'''1> What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior (methods) of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts in OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Classes and Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A class is a template or blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "Object: An object is an instance of a class. Each object can hold different values for its attributes but will have the same methods as defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.\n",
        "It also refers to the practice of restricting access to certain details of an object (data hiding), so that an object's internal state cannot be directly modified by outside code. Instead, access is provided through public methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (called a derived or child class) inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class (called a base or parent class).\n",
        "This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. The child class can also add its own attributes or methods or override the ones it inherits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also enables a method to have different behaviors depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "Method Overloading: The same method name can be used with different parameters.\n",
        "Method Overriding: A child class can redefine or override a method inherited from its parent class to provide its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This is often achieved by using abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
        "It allows a programmer to focus on high-level functionality without worrying about the details of the underlying code."

        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables flexibility, code reuse, and scalability in software design.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Benefits of Polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability\n",
        "A single function can operate on different types of objects, reducing redundant code.\n",
        "The same interface can be used for different implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",

        "✅ The same function works for multiple object types, avoiding code duplication.\n",

        "2. Flexibility & Extensibility\n",
        "New classes can be added without modifying existing code, following the Open-Closed Principle.\n",
        "If a new subclass (e.g., Bird) is introduced, existing functions still work.\n",

        "Polymorphism is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The primary concept behind polymorphism is that different classes can define methods with the same name, and those methods can behave differently depending on the object type.\n",
